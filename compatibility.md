# Compatibility requirements

## 1
data/partials/x-help.html has to be created. It should contain help page.

## 2
Instances without the requests feature can be raised to this version without any changes.

In instances with requests, /schemas/requests.json has to be divided into generalRequests.json, registrationRequests.json, dataChangeRequests.json and transferRequests.json (except for data-sba where only general requests are currently implemented)
This also entails modifying the request-modified handler, x-main-menu and others.
All of this should already be on the respective repos, so only a fetch is needed.

The requests collection in the database also needs to be divided. There are scripts for this in tools/mongo/:

	- splitMigrationCheck.sh - doesn't actually modify the database, it only reports where it would move each request
	- splitMigration.sh - performs the division, drops the 'requests' collection if it ends up being empty

## 3 - Structure of bank records import changed

It is necesary to migrate structure of bank imports. Run `tools/migrations/3.sh`

## 4 - Array component changed

1. Update the schemas in each dataset to use the new array structure

## 5 - RefereeReport schema changes

1. webNumber field changed and relocated in schema
2. RefereeReports are used just in SZH instance, so migration is necessary only there
